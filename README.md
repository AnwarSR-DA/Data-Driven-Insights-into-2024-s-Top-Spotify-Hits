# Introduction
Welcome to my project on analyzing song popularity! ðŸŽ¶

In this project, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of song popularity metrics across various platforms to uncover insights into what makes a song popular. This is a detailed exploration into music data, and I am eager to share my findings and learn from feedback.

# Project Overview
This repository contains an analysis of song popularity across various music platforms using the dataset "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024".

This analysis includes:

1. Song Popularity Analysis: Understanding the characteristics of the most popular songs by comparing metrics such as "Track Score", "Spotify Streams", "YouTube Views", and "TikTok Views" with "All Time Rank".
2. Platform Comparison Analysis: Comparing the popularity of songs across different platforms to see where certain songs perform best.
3. Explicit Content Analysis: Evaluating the impact of explicit content on the popularity and distribution of songs.


# Request for Feedback
